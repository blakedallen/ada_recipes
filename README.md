## Overview

Each recipe can be described in a python file
which is a set of tasks ran. 
Each of these recipes will be small, self contained, are going to have configs as code. 
When things are big enough to warrent splitting off, a module will be written. 

### Recipes

Where code lives, each recipe is a standalone program with mocked data for an example.

### Modules 

Modules are reusable classes and functions for common tasks.
